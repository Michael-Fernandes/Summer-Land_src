# SummerLand
An app that helps you book National park Campsites quickly and without having to crawl through a .gov UI. 

## Current Situation
National Park Campsites are hard to get to. The problem starts when people overbook campsites with the plan of canceling reservations that don't fit their summer schedule.

## What SummerLand Does
Summerland crawls the Recreation.gov site and finds recently vacated campsites. Saving campers time and effort having to stand standby for a reservation to be canceled in order to plan a camping trip 2-3 weeks in advance.

## How it was built
This is an intial version of the app (started 08/08/18). The front end(built by @michael-fernandes) was made with React, while the backend(built by @kevin-prakabar) was made with GO on an AWS EC2 instance.

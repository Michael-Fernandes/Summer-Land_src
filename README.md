#SummerLand
An app that helps you book National park Campsites on the fly. 

##Current Situation
Currently National Park Campsites are hard to get to. Part of the problem is people overbooking campsites and canceling reservations that don't fit their summer schedule.

##What SummerLand Does
Summerland trawls the Recreation.gov site and finds recently vacated campsites in an aggregated fashion. Saving campers time and effort having to stand standby for a reservation to be canceled in order to plan a camping trip 2-3 weeks in advance.

##How it was built
This is an intial version of the app (started 08/08/18). The front end(built by @michael-fernandes) was made with React, while the backend(built by @kevin-prakabar) was made with GO on an AWS EC2 instance.
